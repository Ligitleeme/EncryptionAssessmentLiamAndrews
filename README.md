Encryption Assessment - Liam Andrews

This program has been made to securely encrypt and decrypt data from text files. 
This progrm was built using visual studio code, and made with Python.

The program includes multiple features, including 2 secure encryption methods, one Caesar cipher, and one Polyalphabetic-sub cipher. 
They both have a range of functions, these help tidy up the program, which keeps it clean, and is easy to navigate. 
The other features include functions that ask the user for which chiper they wish to use, and which text document to do so in. 
This also of course allows the user to input a custom key, which is run against both encryption methods.

How to use this application. 
The application once run, will ask the user which encryption method they wish to use. The following can be entered 'c' or 'caesar' for  caesar cipher encryption. Or they can enter 'p' or 'polyalphabetic' for the polyalphabetic cipher.
If the user is confused on what to enter at this stage, the code will inform you on which entries are possible. 
Then, they are asked if they wish to encrypt or decrypt, again by using 'e' or 'encrypt' to encrypt, otherwise they can enter 'd' or 'decrypt' to decrypt. Same as the other choice, the code will inform the user on which entries are avaliable.
Finnaly, the key will be asked. If the user is encrypting, they will need to decide on one of their choice, but if they are decrypting, they will need to know the already made key, to ensure that no authorised persons can access the encrypted data.
